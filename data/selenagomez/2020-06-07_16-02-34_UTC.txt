Please meet Kimberlé Crenshaw (@kimberlecrenshaw - and sandylocks on Twitter). You may have heard of “intersectionality,” “Critical Race Theory,” and “#SayHerName,” but had no idea where they came from. Kimberlé co-founded the African American Policy Forum (@aapolicyforum), hosts the podcast @intersectionalitymatters, teaches law at UCLA and Columbia, and moderates the weekly conversation series “Under The Blacklight.” Today, she’s taking over my Instagram!
