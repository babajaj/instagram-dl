After the police killings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown in 2014, AAPF joined thousands of others to protest anti-Black police brutality, marching under a banner with the names of Black women killed by police. When we didn’t hear their names, we began chanting “Say! Her! Name!” That’s when our #SayHerName campaign was born. Working with families of slain Black women, we resist their invisibility by telling their stories. ⠀

We cannot fix a problem we cannot see. Join us in this fight: https://aapf.org/supportshn and @aapolicyforum
