Footage is from the @nytimes of Tuesday’s wait lines outside of polls in Georgia. This is what happens when the votes of communities of color are actively suppressed by state governments. Organizations like @blackvotersmtr & @workingfamilies are leading the charge in ensuring these voter suppression efforts fail. We do this by talking to voters about the issues and getting them to the ballot box. You can join @workingfamilies efforts to get out the vote by texting WFP to 30403. ⠀

Lastly we are supporting @mvmnt4blklives for their national weekend of action.⠀
