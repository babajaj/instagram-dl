We had to do a lot of work during quarantine -we couldn’t have a regular photoshoot with a professional photographer or makeup artist. We sent each model our Liquid Touch Weightless Foundation, Liquid Touch Brightening Concealer, and Always An Optimist Illuminating Primer. We had them apply it themselves (super easy to use) and take a selfie. And it’s out NOW only at @sephora and ‪RareBeauty.com‬!!
