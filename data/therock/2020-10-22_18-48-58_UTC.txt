A lil’ throwback action to 1983, when I was 11 years old - I used to LOVE putting on my dad’s wrestling trunks, boots, jacket and championship belts - dreaming of one day becoming a pro wrestling champion 💪🏾

Only thing I forgot to wear was my training bra!! 🤦🏽‍♂️

C’mon afro tits, you’re gonna be late for school! 🤣
