👈🏾 swipe! WOW! AMAZING and I’m truly honored this artist @jamesonealwoodart would create this powerful art 🙏🏾

Eight feet three inches tall, 428 pounds. 

Single piece of red oak. 

In and out of the wrestling ring, whether I win or lose - good days or bad days - my right arm raised ✊🏾 will always represent my principles and tell my story. 

My story of life ✊🏾

And thanks Jim for giving me some sweet “pre-cheat meal” abs 🤣👊🏾
