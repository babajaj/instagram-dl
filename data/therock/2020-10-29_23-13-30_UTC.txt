Just gonna leave this Christmas throwback right here for everyone around the world’s enjoyment...

4yrs old.

Teeth bucked and discolored. 

Rocking a perm. WTF!? 

And for the record, EVERYONE thought I was a little girl growing up 🤣🙋🏽‍♂️

And clearly even at a very young age, I always had “a way” with all the girls 😘 - mainly because they thought I was one 😂. 

And thanks for the awesome haircut mom 👍🏾🤦🏽‍♂️
