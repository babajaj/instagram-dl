I was all set to become the wisest king of all - MUFASA, buuuut unfortunately the costume didn’t quite fit my body. 

But at least my Lion’s mane headpiece is beautiful with a dash of sexy and fits me PERFECTLY👌🏾👹

Yup, if 2020 was a Halloween costume this would be it 🤣🤦🏽‍♂️

Still had a great quarantine Halloween and the babies had a blast - hope you guys did as well.
