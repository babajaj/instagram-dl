Time to go to work. 
(before I go to my other work) 

Takinâ€™ a brief quiet moment to take her in one more time ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ 

A defining day for her today. 

To me, nothing will ever rival her awesome beauty, her strength, her resolve and most of all, her humanity. 

Regardless of where it all goes, Iâ€™ll always have her back - as I know, sheâ€™ll always have mine. 

Grateful to grind today and break some new skin on these calluses.
