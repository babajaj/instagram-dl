Welcome to Rome 🇮🇹 (sorta)

For our globe trotting movie, RED NOTICE we were all set to film at the famed museum CASTEL SANT’ ANGELO, in Rome, Italy. 

When the pandemic shut our world down - we regrouped, re-strategized and decided the show must go on. 

So we built the museum ourselves. 

Every last incredible detail - inside and out. 

As producer, I’m extremely proud of our hungry and brilliant/
Production designer 
Art directors 
Construction teams
Set decorators 

And ALL OF OUR CREW who accepted this daunting challenge during COVID of coming back to finish what we started. 

Hardest workers in the room who always finish the job. 

CAN’T WAIT for all of you around the world to see this movie on NETFLIX.
