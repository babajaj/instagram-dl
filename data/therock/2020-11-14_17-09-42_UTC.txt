🤯 SWIPE LEFT 
I usually have a cool and calm demeanor when I hear good news, but admittedly when I heard this I said, “HOLY SHIT MY SONG WENT QUADRUPLE F*CKING PLATINUM??” 😂🤦🏽‍♂️🙏🏾

Thank you to my brother - the one and only iconic maestro, Lin Manuel Miranda for writing this classic for me to sing and the world to sing along to. 

Thank you to all of you around the world 🌎 who love the song and the swaggy, fun it brings. 

And finally, a huge daddy thank you to the real reason this song is 4Xs Platinum and growing - my 2 year old boss, Baby Tia who LOVES hearing me sing this song to her, but has no idea I’m actually, Maui - which kinda makes this whole thing that much more awesome. 💁🏽‍♂️☺️

And one last thing...

You’re welcome... and thank you 😉💪🏾
