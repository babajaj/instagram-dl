Aaaaand guess who’s too big to fit in yet another sports car and now we have to change the entire shot sequence around 🙋🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️

For our @netflix globe trotting heist movie, RED NOTICE, my writer/director @rawsonthurber (pictured here on the ground setting up the new camera angle) wrote this INSANE chase sequence where I hop in this iconic Porsche and be the bad ass behind the wheel that I am. 

Well, after months of prep and costs 💰 buying and shipping this car over to the states - it’s time to rehearse the big chase sequence. 

It goes as follows/

Rawson: Hey D, let’s get you in the Porsche and I’ll line up the shot. 

DJ: Let’s do it. 

* DJ attempts to get into the car only to get stuck because his back is a bit too wide. 

Rawson: * laughs. 

* DJ continues to struggle trying to shimmy into this Porsche like a big ass brown marshmallow getting shoved into a coin slot. 

Rawson: Wait can you fit? 

DJ: No. 

*Rawson now nervously laughs. 

Rawson: Are you fucking with me? 

DJ: No. 

Rawson: Oh my God. 

After about 15 seconds of uncomfortable silence... Rawson, myself and the entire crew just started laughing our asses off!! 😂😂 

Fuck it. Welcome to 2020. 🤣

In the end we showed our agility to think quick on our feet and found “creative” ways to still get the shot. ☝🏾👏🏾👊🏾 🎥
