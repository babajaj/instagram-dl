That’s an official wrap on RED NOTICE. 

Thank you to my writer/director @rawsonthurber for being the quiet force behind this film. 

From becoming the biggest pitch sale in the history of Hollywood 👏🏾👏🏾 to finally landing at its powerful home of @netflix - to being shut down due to the pandemic back in March, to galvanizing back up to finish strong. 
Our movie has had quite the amazing/challenging journey and it’s been a pleasure going shoulder to shoulder with you again. 

Keep on keepin’ on.
