Excellent work week on set of our new TV series, “YOUNG ROCK” coming soon to @NBC. 

Working very closely with our series creator, Nahnatchka Khan. 
She’s a brilliant (and very funny) creative partner who I trust with my wild life story growing up. 

We examine every word from every character because these are all real people, real family who are still in my life and those who have passed away. 

Gotta be authentic and get it right. 
The good, the bad, the heartbreaking, the heartwarming and the f*cking hilarious. 

Can’t wait for you guys to watch this show.
