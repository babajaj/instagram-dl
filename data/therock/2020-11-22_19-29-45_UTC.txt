Eyebrow action 🔥🤨 on set of our new TV series, “YOUNG ROCK” for @NBC. 

A little inside intel - I started doing the “people’s eyebrow” when I was 13yrs old. 

The ladies loved it 😈
So boom I did it. 
It worked on all the girls. 
Made their backs crack and their livers quiver. 
Didn’t work on my teachers though. 

Hello detention, I’m Dwayne and I’ll be spending some time with you today 🙋🏾‍♂️
