Some fantastic days on set of our new @NBCYoungRock. 

Hereâ€™s mini me hanging at our house with wrestling legend, THE JUNKYARD DOG played by @mrnatejackson. 

I was born into the wild, crazy and unpredictable world of pro wrestling. 

And as a little boy, to me - these guys were REAL superheroes. 

No capes. Just big, bad ass and fun dudes. Who always showed tough love.

Canâ€™t wait for you to watch this one!
