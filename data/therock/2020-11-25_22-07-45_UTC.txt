Mini me on set of @NBCYoungRock with the originator of the word, “Jabroni” — the one and the only, THE IRON SHEIK played by @brettazar. 

Sheik has been a very close family friend since I was born. As a matter of fact, his wife used to baby sit my little bad ass when I was a kid 🤣🤦🏽‍♂️

Former Gold medalist and wrestling coach for our USA Team in the Olympic Games in Munich, Germany, Sheik was an incredible athlete. 

As many wrestling historians will attest - at one time, The Iron Sheik was one of THE legit baddest SOB’s walking the planet. 

And one of the biggest lessons he taught me as a kid - he said, “bubba.. listen to Sheik-ee baby... always keep your mouth shut.. you always learn more when you keep your mouth shut and listen to people teaching the lesson..” 

True story. 😄👊🏾

Thank you, Sheik-ee! 
Love you, Bubba 👊🏾

We’re making something pretty cool and can’t wait for you to watch!
