On set of our new @NBCYoungRock - and the day I learned a GIANT LESSON from the man I affectionately and always called, “Uncle Andre” growing up... 

Ladies and gentlemen, the 8th Wonder of the World - ANDRE’ THE GIANT played by @mojowillig. 

Andre’ was very close to my family and would often come by our apartment to hang, drink beer (and bottles of wine;) and play cards. 

Anytime he had to lay some gospel on me, he’d pick me up so we were ALWAYS eye to eye. 

That was always important to Uncle Andre - RESPECT. 

I learned that lesson quick 🤣 and that’s one I carry with me for life 🙏🏾

Thank you, Boss. 
Give my dad and grandparents a big squeeze up there ❤️🍻 

Can’t wait for all of you to watch our new series. I think you’re gonna like it.
