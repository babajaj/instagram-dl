Seeing this image of actor, @officialjosephleeanderson playing my dad, Rocky Johnson (RIP Soulman) really sat me down💔😢 

On set of our new @nbc TV series, YOUNG ROCK - a show that explores my insanely wild childhood and all the many lessons life has thrown at me and my family along the way. 

My dad suddenly passed away earlier this year. 
Never had a chance to say goodbye to my old man, which really sucks - but as he always said, “hey the show must go on”. 

And so it will. 

Hope you’re proud of this one Soulman... who would’ve ever thought huh!? 🥃

Wanted you guys to see this “first look” at my pops. 
No filters, no polish and nothing fancy. Just the Soulman doing what he did best! 

Can’t wait for you guys to watch our new show. I think you’re gonna like it.
