Culture is a powerful tool. It creates narratives that can honor human life or denigrate it.\u2800 \u2800 Law alone did not result in the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Sandra Bland, Travyon Martin, or any of the other unnamed lives lost due to racial terror. Law combined with culture shapes our social narratives. It can justify biases and stereotypes with deadly consequences. \u2800 \u2800 But this is also the good news. It means that we all have a role to play by how we shape, make, and engage with the culture around us. \u2800 \u2800 This is a 1 day Instagram class called, \u201cHow to See in a Racial Crisis.\u201d You will get a new set of tools in the posts and stories through resources and artists to follow.

Racial terror has impacted them all.\u2800 \u2800 How we choose to see each day can be a form of daily activism.

Bites to humans are less common than with other African cobras but still a life-threatening emergency.  Ironically the lethal characteristics of snake venom make it  so valuable and sought after for use in medicinal treatments. The toxic components of snake venom have, for example, led to the development of medicine against heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's.

", "Photo by @renaeffendiphoto / Over the years, I have documented the plight of the more than 700,000 people displaced by the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in Azerbaijan in the 1990s. I found them living in miserable, inhumane conditions: some sheltered in dug-out holes meant for livestock, others squatted in abandoned train cars and industrial ruins of factories. In Azerbaijani language, \"qa\u00e7q\u0131n\" (refugee) became widely synonymous with \"poor\" and \"dejected.\" As two decades went by, new generations of children were born into the limbo of muffled hopes that one day they\u2019d be able to return home. For these vulnerable communities pushed to the margins of society, the pain of being uprooted by conflict became a deeply entrenched trauma that passed on to the next generations.   I hope that the end of hostilities in Nagorno-Karabakh will evolve into a sustained and lasting peace that will give both sides displaced by this conflict a chance to go home and rebuild their lives. It will take years before they can rehabilitate physically and emotionally from these traumatic events. I am Azerbaijani, and it\u2019s been very disturbing for me to observe thousands of Armenians fleeing Nagorno-Karabakh over the past month. I don\u2019t wish them the same fate of the Azerbaijani refugees I had photographed.   For generations, Azerbaijanis and Armenians have been living in peace side by side. But fueled by our respective identity crisis, this smoldering conflict is a product of two opposing nationalist narratives constructed and fed to us over the years. These narratives are damaging to our human psyche and our ability to co-exist peacefully. I hope the day will come when we can see each other not as two warring ethnicities, but as humans: friends, neighbors, business partners, relatives, just the way we used to be in the past. #Azerbaijan #Armenia #NKpeace ", "Photo by @amytoensing / Exploring the woods near our camp in the Adirondack region of New York.

This novel class of renewable biomaterial may replace petroleum-based products that take many years to decompose, if ever. The search for new materials is part of my March cover story for National Geographic magazine on the circular economy. By designing waste out of the production system, circularity aims to keep resources and materials in use while regenerating natural systems.   Scientists say we only have a few years to halt and reverse our overconsumption, our emissions, and our wasteful attitude in order to save our changing climate, the natural habitats, and, ultimately, ourselves.

The resulting economic fallout has been catastrophic for the community there, leaving thousands of people struggling to put food on the table while still paying their bills. In response to the overwhelming need, nonprofits, aid groups, churches, and government organizations, as well as private citizens and volunteers, have come together to donate and distribute food all over the city. One such program is CENTI, a community church where every Tuesday, church members and volunteers hand out boxes of groceries from the USDA to hundreds of Queens residents who often wait in line for hours for the help.   Here, Ciria Santiago (second from the left) joins a group of volunteers in packaging the food after the truck from USDA arrived. Ciria, who lost her business due to the pandemic, volunteers at several food handout sites each week because she prefers to spend the time she would otherwise spend in line for food helping instead.

A @vanessakingori thread. . Being a mum is the only role I ever really knew I wanted and it doesn\u2019t disappoint (sleep deprivation aside), I LOVE it. But getting to this point was a bumpy road.  I suffered with fibroids that went undiagnosed and dismissed by healthcare professionals for years this coupled with stress caused by working in a toxic male environment full of all the associated isms created unsavoury cocktail leading to multiple miscarriages. Each of which broke me in a way that is indescribable.  I left the job, ignored the fibroid advice (just leave them!? Really?) did my own health research which lead to surgery AND finally got pregnant \u2728.  But then came the real worry.  Black women in the U.K. are 5 times more likely to die during pregnancy, irrespective of how much money they can throw at \u2018good\u2019 health care. The stat. is similar for the USA.

Reports indicate that the police were on the scene to respond to a domestic dispute, and the victim was attempting to help settle it (Kenosha News). A video of the shooting was widely circulated on social media. In the video, the victim can be seen walking to his car and opening the door before being restrained by a police officer and shot point-blank in the back. A reporter for WISN, a news channel in Wisconsin, later confirmed that the victim is 29-year-old Jacob Blake (Twitter). A large group of people was present to witness the shooting, in addition to his fianc\u00e9e and children.

In the past year, 19 states in the US have introduced horrific legislation targeting trans youth and their ability to play sports simply because of who they are.\u00a0\u00a0   Because of COVID-19, LGBTQI+ youth are at increased risk of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. Sports are proven to reduce depression for LGBTQI+ youth. All athletes, and especially trans youth, deserve life-saving access to sports. Join Athlete Ally and help us fight to make sports welcoming for all.   #TDOR #PROTECTTRANSYOUTH ", "#TransAwarenessWeek \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc97\ud83e\udd0d\ud83c\udf08\u2728 Repost from @trevorproject: #TransAwarenessWeek\u00a0is an important time to educate and advocate for the rights of\u00a0#trans\u00a0and\u00a0#nonbinary\u00a0people \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc99 art by\u00a0@sarah.epperson\u00a0\ud83c\udfa8 If you're in crisis, we're here for you 24/7 at: 866.488.7386 or visit thetrevorproject.org/help ", "It\u2019s #NationalVoterRegistrationDay \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\uddf3\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\u2764\ufe0f It\u2019ll take less than 2 minutes.

I answer: a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim.  To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciations of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade, and solemnity, are, to him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy\u2014a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages. \u00a0 There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices, more shocking and bloody, than are the people of these United States, at this very hour.  Allow me to say, in conclusion, notwithstanding the dark picture I have this day presented, of the state of the nation, I do not despair of this country. There are forces in operation which must inevitably work the downfall of slavery. \"The arm of the Lord is not shortened,\" and the doom of slavery is certain.

Trust that you have all of the power within to make this happen, and in order to do that connect to the people and things that bring you a lot of joy. When the mind starts to move into overthinking or fear, shift your attention right away to something bright. It doesn\u2019t matter what has happened in the past or what is happening around us now, you can always make the choice to break free of the wheel of suffering and panic and open up to your own light. We are powerful manifestors , so once you make the choice in the moment to shift your awareness to something good, it will show you in your reality. Be conscious, especially right now of fears coming in from others, and recognize that not everything should be held by you. Laughter is your best medicine, but tears can also be a powerful release. Let go of any judgment you may have around that. Remember that you are never alone, and if you need to be reminded of that ask for support and it will show up. Everything comes down to intention, and even though there are conflicting energies circling around us you must KNOW...It will rebuild. But in order for that to happen, you have to do exactly that. Trust. You have the biggest heart and that is your greatest gift. It\u2019s impossible to always control your surroundings, but when you shift the focus to how you want to feel, everything will conspire to assist you.

EVERY. TIME. feels more disheartening and nauseating because our cries for the Government and Americans to do better seem unheard; but even when we feel like what we do isn\u2019t enough or can\u2019t help, we have to do more. Keep signing petitions, making calls to demand justice, speaking out (this is not just if you have a big platform- it starts in your homes and communities), and fighting to make a difference for every life that has been wrongly taken or effected by THE PANDEMIC OF RACISM.

There is lots of work to be done, and more resources are desperately needed, but I\u2019m hopeful for the future after seeing the enthusiasm these young women have for change. I know they will be holding President Mutharika to his commitment to end child marriage in Malawi within five years! #goal5  My jacket and trousers are from @edun.

The material is untreated which avoids any harmful chemical treatments or finishing processes, which is much better for the environment.  Shoes were by @ancientgreeksandals.

The UK is the country I was brought up in, the country that I vote in and a country whose own history of systemic racism has shaped those elsewhere - American and British histories of racial oppression are very much intertwined. But it wasn\u2019t until I became a student in an American university and was taught British history from an outsider\u2019s perspective that I really started to understand the racial violence that scars British history. As a child I grew up with a school curriculum that totally glossed over British colonialism and British slavery. And any teaching around black civil rights movements were focussed on the American experience - as @renieddolodge points out in her book, Black History Month in the UK often ends up offering British children timelines of American activists. For me, understanding our past is a crucial part of understanding the injustices and inequalities of our present and remaking our future as a nation. Our school education system is key - the stories the national curriculum tells us about who we are, and the voices it centres, create a blueprint for how we interpret and interact with the world around us. As an adult, I\u2019ve benefited from the work of people like @renieddolodge, David Olusoga, @johnymodern, @afuahirsch @akalamusic, Paul Gilroy, Stuart Hall and many others to help me understand my country\u2019s history.

She makes what otherwise can be arduous and depressing reading, into something not only relatable but enjoyable...She believes in personal testimony - the sharing and passing on of women\u2019s stories...She uncovers things that are obscured by today\u2019s conditioning and normalizing which when exposed, are absolutely fascinating...Her plain common sense - calling things out as they are - will make you laugh out loud... \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 Sometimes the world she envisions seems so far out and impossible to me or just wildly optimistic. But I have come to believe it is through radical feminism and the radical nature of Gloria\u2019s message, that the job of equality will get done. I used to think the citadel didn\u2019t have to topple. Now I believe it just might and should, and that we need to let old ways of being die for something new to be born.

A new word? More men involved? I would rephrase the question. What obstacles need to be removed for us to succeed? In order to win our full humanity, in life, we have to confront the biggest superpower in the world: the patriarchy... \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 I never liked the idea of being a rebel.

Rupi Kaur is an Indian-born, Canadian-raised poet and artist. She chooses not to use upper case letters or punctuation in her poems as an ode to her native language, Punjabi. She travels the world, including recently to her native country India, performing her poems and drawing crowds of hundreds. Both of her books, Milk and Honey and The Sun and Her Flowers, have made the New York Times bestseller list, which for a poet, is astonishing. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Over my lifetime, I have fallen in and out of love with poetry. Performing poems was what got me into acting (I had a primary school teacher that made everyone learn one a week, and eventually I won a poetry recital competition!) In secondary school and at university, I loved deciphering the codes of poems in class discussion, but I honestly wondered if poetry would continue to feature in my life outside of an academic context. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Enter poets like @holliepoetry, @SabrinaMahfouz and Rupi Kaur- I demolished whole books in single sittings. Unlike poems I have often spent weeks unraveling, Rupi\u2019s poems are not designed to obscure meaning or entertain too much ambiguity - they hit you like punches to the stomach. They are immediate, visceral and not easily digested. I am loathe to say Rupi has made poetry \u201caccessible\u201d because while this is the truth (Rupi\u2019s poems and illustrations fit well into those famously square shaped Instagram frames), there is nothing easy or accessible about what Rupi chooses to talk about. In fact, the topics she chooses, are audacious. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Here is a 25-year-old girl saying the unsayable\u2026 to hundreds of thousands of people: that she has been raped, that at times she has been abused, that she bleeds.

But look around you, the monsters walk beside you.  From anybody who throws stones at a stray dog to anybody hurting a living soul, choose one face.  A lot of these animals trust human beings because they have been helped by them in the past.  This is cruel beyond measure. When you lack empathy and kindness, you do not deserve to be called a human being. To hurt someone is not human.  Just stricter laws won't help. We need a decent execution of the law too.

I didn\u2019t share this with you guys at the time because honestly I was just trying to be okay, but I was experiencing severe anxiety. it was meditation- it was practicing every single day multiple times a day that has been healing me, and, more than just helping me manage strong emotions like anxiety and stress, it\u2019s making me a better human.  not only  does it help in times like this with stress and anxiety, meditation is the practice of strengthening habits like empathy, love, and compassion- making you feel more connected to not only everybody around you , but living beings in general like animals, plants,  and the earth, which is a living being, itself. In times like these, especially as young people, even if we are healthy, it\u2019s important to practice compassion and help others that could be suffering. We are in this together, let\u2019s not be indifferent to others risk. it\u2019s our responsibility to do whatever it takes to keep everyone safe. Empathy to others\u2019 reality and solidarity could make the difference in hard moments like this.  We can\u2019t think that we will be unaffected because we feel young and healthy. we have parents, grandparents, friends, and  neighbors, and we don\u2019t want to be a part of the problem when we could be part of the solution. So I\u2019d like you to take 10 minutes of your day today to either look up loving kindness meditation on Calm or YouTube. Or just follow these instructions: close your eyes and sit with your spine upright and feel gravity grounding your body to the earth\u2019s surface and supporting you. Take three deep breaths and then begin to just notice the natural flow of your breath. Being aware of breathing in, breathing out. Following every inhale and exhale with your attention. Once your mind has stilled. Picture every human in the world right now, elders, people that have respiratory problems and are vulnerable, picture the people that are vulnerable, picture their families, and say \u201cMay you be healthy. May you be safe. May you be free from illness. May you be well.\u201d Repeat until you really feel it in your heart \u2764\ufe0f- love you guys, please stay safe !

Let me be clear, I don\u2019t want to disrespect my religion, my culture, but being shamed to the point where I have felt embarrassed to tell my mom I was pregnant is also not ok. Everyone should feel comfortable expressing themselves the way they feel embraces who they are. Shooting this video was important for me bc it\u2019s not about anyone else, it\u2019s never been about me wanting to feel more sexy for anyone, it\u2019s about me owning every part of who am and that includes the sexy me!

Satellite data shows that the climate crisis is heating the Arctic at double the rate in lower latitudes, and the ice cap is the biggest single contributor to sea level rise, which already imperils coasts around the world.  The ice sheet shrank by 532bn tonnes last year as its surface melted and glaciers fell into the ocean. These could have filled seven Olympic-sized swimming pools per second.  Snowfall in Greenland was low in 2019, also due to the blocking pattern, meaning relatively little new ice was added. If the entire Greenland ice sheet melts, sea level would rise by six metres.  But despite the rapid melting, the Greenland ice sheet isn't necessarily doomed to melt entirely. Firstly, as glaciers retreat they lose contact with warmer ocean waters and therefore melt less. Secondly, the melting of the sheet with warm air takes centuries, during which time we might be able to reverse the rise in global temperatures.
